The system uses a microservices architecture where each service runs in its own container, enabling focused testing of infrastructure components including identity management, media processing, and service observability.\n\nThe infrastructure is scoped to a single AWS Availability Zone to cover the full deployment lifecycle while managing resource overhead. This setup supported hands-on work with Kubernetes cluster configuration, VPC networking, CI/CD pipeline setup, and monitoring — without the added complexity of multi-AZ failover.\n\nA key focus was automating infrastructure provisioning and deployment workflows. The project includes an event-driven media processing pipeline using serverless functions, and all cloud resources are managed using Infrastructure as Code to maintain consistency across environments.\n\nThis project demonstrates practical skills in Kubernetes deployment, CI/CD pipeline configuration, infrastructure automation, and operating distributed services in a single-zone cloud environment.",
