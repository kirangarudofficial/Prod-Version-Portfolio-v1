PROJECT 1 — LEARNSPHERE (Learning Hub Platform)
📌 Description (Portfolio Version)

LearnSphere is a large-scale cloud-based learning platform designed to simulate how modern distributed applications operate in real environments. The system is built using a microservices architecture where each service is independently deployed and managed, allowing the platform to support complex features such as course management, user authentication, video streaming, analytics, and real-time communication.

A major focus of this project was automation and operational design. The platform includes a serverless media pipeline that automatically processes uploaded videos into multiple streaming formats. The infrastructure is fully provisioned using Infrastructure as Code, enabling reproducible deployments and consistent environments.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with container orchestration, CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure design, observability practices, and distributed system management.

⭐ Key Highlights (Expanded)
• Domain-Driven Microservices Architecture

Designed dozens of independent services organized by functional domains such as authentication, learning content, payments, communication, and analytics to ensure modularity and maintainability.

• API Gateway & Service Communication Design

Implemented centralized API routing and structured service-to-service communication patterns to handle request flow efficiently across distributed components.

• Serverless Video Processing Pipeline

Built a fully automated pipeline that triggers cloud functions upon file upload, processes media using FFmpeg, generates thumbnails, and updates metadata without manual intervention.

• Adaptive Video Streaming System

Configured storage workflows to convert media into streaming formats suitable for multiple device types and bandwidth conditions.

• Infrastructure as Code Automation

Provisioned entire cloud environments using Terraform modules, including networking, container clusters, storage services, and IAM configurations.

• Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

Deployed services across multiple namespaces with resource quotas, network policies, and isolation strategies to maintain stability and control resource usage.

• CI/CD Standardization with Shared Libraries

Created reusable CI workflows to automate building, testing, containerization, and deployment across multiple services.

• GitOps Deployment Workflow

Implemented continuous deployment using declarative configuration management, ensuring automated synchronization between source control and runtime environments.

• Containerized Data Platform

Configured stateful workloads including relational databases, document stores, and caching systems with persistent storage and backup strategies.

• Monitoring & Observability Integration

Established centralized dashboards for metrics, logs, and system health to enable proactive troubleshooting and operational visibility.

• Security & Access Control Design

Applied identity-based access policies, secure secret management practices, and role-based permissions across infrastructure components.

• Automated Backup & Data Protection Strategy

Implemented scheduled backups and storage lifecycle policies to ensure data durability and recovery readiness.
