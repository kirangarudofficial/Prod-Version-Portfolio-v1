PROJECT 2 — CODEMENTOR AI PLATFORM
📌 Description (Portfolio Version)

CodeMentor AI is a cloud-based AI infrastructure platform designed to provide students with an interactive environment for AI-assisted coding and experimentation. The system focuses on deploying and managing AI workloads efficiently while maintaining cost optimization and operational reliability.

The platform uses Kubernetes to isolate frontend and AI processing workloads into separate compute environments. It also integrates monitoring systems, security controls, and automation scripts to streamline deployment and operations.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of cloud infrastructure design, workload isolation strategies, resource optimization techniques, and automation-driven deployment workflows.

🛠 Tech Stack

AWS • Kubernetes (EKS) • Terraform
Ollama AI Runtime • Helm • Bash
CloudWatch • Grafana • IAM

⭐ Key Highlights (Expanded)
• Dual Node Group Infrastructure Design

Separated AI processing workloads and application services into distinct compute environments to improve performance and resource efficiency.

• Cost-Optimized Cloud Architecture

Designed infrastructure using optimized resource allocation, network configuration, and compute scaling strategies to reduce operational costs.

• AI Runtime Deployment Strategy

Configured containerized AI environments capable of running locally hosted models for secure and controlled execution.

• Automated Infrastructure Provisioning

Built automation scripts to deploy clusters, configure networking, and initialize runtime environments without manual setup.

• Secure Network Architecture

Implemented subnet isolation, security groups, and access controls to protect internal services from unauthorized access.

• Kubernetes Workload Isolation

Used namespace segmentation and resource limits to maintain stability between AI workloads and frontend services.

• Monitoring & Resource Visibility

Integrated monitoring dashboards to track CPU, memory, and workload performance for proactive system management.

• Automated Deployment Workflow

Designed scripts to automate application deployment, configuration updates, and lifecycle operations.

• Logging & Operational Insights

Configured centralized logging systems to capture runtime activity and support debugging processes.

• Scalable AI Processing Environment

Designed infrastructure capable of scaling compute resources based on workload demand without impacting application availability.
